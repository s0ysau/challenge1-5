Relatively straight forward, we created a function called addTwo and have the parameter add 2 and return that result.

Similiar to the first challenge, we take a parameter of a string and added the 's' to the end of the value and return that string.

To create a new map, we first created a newMap function on line 3 with two parameters: arr and params. Then we create an empty arr and a for loop to loop the arr parameter. We, then, push the looped arr into the newArr and return newArr.

The callback function, multiplyByTwo, on line 11, is then initiated via params in the newMap function and takes the newArr that was created and multiplies each of the index in the array by 2.

To create our own forEach function, we put the params in a variable inside the block scope first turned it into a string then remove the commas and return that value.

In this challenge, we created a simple server.js file and imported express (line 1) and a seed file that was given to us (line3) 

We, then, created three routes for index (line 6), show (line 10) and create blog entries (line 14). 

Finally, on line 19, we created a method to tell us that the app is running on Port 3005.
