```
function addTwo (num) {
  return num = num + 2
}

console.log(addTwo(4))
```

Relatively straight forward, we created a function called addTwo and have the parameter add 2 and return that result.

Similiar to the first challenge, we take a parameter of a string and added the 's' to the end of the value and return that string.

To create our own forEach function, we put the params in a variable inside the block scope first turned it into a string then remove the commas and return that value.
